<h1>Decrement Coin</h1>
<h3>Decrement Coin is a crypto currency built on top of the Ethereum blockchain</h3>
<h3>It follows the ERC-20 Token standard and is a self burning token.</h3>
<h3>10% of all the value of transactions is burned so the token supply trends to zero.</h3>
<h3>The token is fully claimable for free and each claimee gets 13.37 tokens. There is a maximum of 100 claimees and the same address can only claim once.</h3>
<h3>The max supply of the token once everyone has claimed is 1337 tokens.</h3>
<h3>The full supply of the token is originally initiated to the ethereum burn address and transfered to the user when claimed. Whenever a transaction is made 10% of the value is sent back to the burn address and becomes burned.</h3>
<h3>The token is fully programmed in Solidity.</h3>
<h2>Decrement Coin is Currently Deployed on Ethereum Ropsten Test Net</h2>
